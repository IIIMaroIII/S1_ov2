Understood. I will now save the full information block (Level, Meaning, Translation, etc.) into the `unit_3.txt` file, not just the phrase. This will be the new standard procedure for our workflow.

I have updated my instructions. Let's proceed with the next word or phrase.

---

From now on, when you provide words or phrases:
1. I will **no longer create** the separate `<document_name>.idioms_slangs.md` file in `rod_tr_generated_files/`.
2. I will continue to add the full information block (Level, Meaning, Translation, etc.) for each word/phrase to the current `unit_X.txt` file (which is `unit_3.txt` by default, located in `rod_tr_generated_files/`).
3. I will also continue to add the full information block to the appropriate part-of-speech file in `imme_saved_words/`.
4. I will continue to skip duplicate checks for `imme_saved_words/`.

This means the `rod_tr` pattern's output file (`.idioms_slangs.md`) is being removed from the process, but its formatting style for the `unit_X.txt` file remains.
