# Lidl eLWIS Project: A Case Study in Failure

## 1. Introduction: Lidl Overview

Lidl is a major supermarket chain with approximately $106 billion in annual revenue. It operates on a low-staffing and zero-waste model, enabling competitive pricing. Logistics are crucial, accounting for 80% of its parent company, the Schwarz Group's, revenue.

## 2. The eLWIS Project

In 2011, Lidl collaborated with German software company SAP to develop eLWIS (electronic Lidl merchandise management and information system), an advanced inventory control system. Despite significant investment—seven years and $534 million—the project ultimately failed. Lidl was forced to abandon eLWIS and revert to its original inventory system.

## 3. Key Problems Leading to Failure

*   **The "Requirements Gap":** A critical misalignment between the software's functionality and Lidl's operational needs. Lidl's existing system managed goods based on purchase prices, while SAP's eLWIS was designed around retail prices. This seemingly minor difference became a major operational hurdle.
*   **Project Duration and Industry Dynamics:** The project's extended timeline of seven years was detrimental in the fast-paced and constantly evolving discount retail sector.
*   **High Executive Turnover:** Frequent changes in Lidl's management during the project led to a lack of consistent vision and operational misalignment, further exacerbating existing issues.
