A RIDE THAT RUNS ON TIME
"heme parks are big business these days. Millions of
visitors buy tickets to enjoy the rides at Universal Studios in Florida or Disneyland Paris and each
year visitor expectations are higher. To survive in this
competitive world, every major theme park needs its new attraction, which requires years of upfront planning.
Phase one in most projects begins with brainstorming. The theme park designers think about the story behind
the ride and its imagined geographical location. No idea is
considered too crazy at this stage as there are no budget constraints - yet. Once the basic idea is agreed, each part
of the ride is storyboarded, like scenes from a film. The
images from the storyboard are then transformed into a combination of 3D models of the ride and images on
a computer. At this point, the design team presents the
concept to the main project manager and tries to provide an accurate forecast of the time needed to complete the
project and a realistic budget.
Once the project is given the go ahead, phase two
begins and the project team starts to work with other engineers, model makers and sound and lighting
designers. In order not to miss the deadline, the project
will need a wide range of people with specialist skills, and many parts of the process are outsourced. This is
a critical period when it's easy to run into problems. It would only take one of the teams to fall behind schedule
or go over budget and the whole project could be delayed. Assuming the construction phase stays on track,
there then follows a long period of safety testing and assessment of the ride's performance. Having made the
launch date, the park starts to monitor visitor feedback; they survey visitors, and the overall success of the new ride will be calculated over time by the number of visitors
choosing to go on the ride every hour.
